By taking this collaborative approach, you:
- ‚úÖ Build positive relationships with established players
- ‚úÖ Gain credibility through association  
- ‚úÖ Access existing community and audience
- ‚úÖ Create win-win scenarios for everyone
- ‚úÖ Establish yourself as a community builder, not just a code writer

**Remember**: The most successful open source projects are built on collaboration, not competition. nano-vLLM's success can become your launch pad, but only if you approach it with respect, humility, and genuine value creation.
